Title:  "You Are Loved"

## English Writing : Day 20

### You are loved.

Dear lovely human, someone out there loves you dearly.\
There's nowhere to run or hide from the love that you deserve.\
This love is for you, not because you earned it, but because it's just for you.\
You are designed for this unconditional love.\
Even if you don't feel it, it doesn't matter, because you can start giving that love to yourself.\
When you wake up in the morning, when you are walking alone feeling sad, when you are feeling like no one's going to choose you, tell yourself, "I love myself." "I'll always be with myself." "I'll always  choose myself."\
That's exactly what I did when I was at rock bottom.\
If you have your own back, you will feel much more empowered.\
So let me remind you again.\
You matter.\
You are loved.

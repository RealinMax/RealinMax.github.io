Title:  "Take Full Ownership"
---

## English Writing : Day 28

### Take full ownership.

No one can give you the certainty that you need.\
No one can give you the perfect feeling you search for in others.\
Whatever you seek, you can find it from within yourself.\
The more you try to find the solutions from outside, the more you will be blinded from your own genius.\
Just take the first step.\
Take full ownership of your feelings.\
It will look something like this.\
- You don't expect someone else to make you feel better.
- You make the choice, not because of someone, but because that's what you truly want.

If you can fully take charge of your life, you will get everything you'll ever need.

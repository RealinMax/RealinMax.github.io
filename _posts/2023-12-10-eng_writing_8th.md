## English Writing : Day 8

### Be committed.

You are always one commitment away from changing the whole trajectory of your life.\
Being committed means you do what you promised to do no matter what.\
If you make a commitment to put in the time and effort to constantly do something every day, no matter how trivial and basic it may look, it will shaprpen you skills and shape you into the person you are meant to be in the future.\
Maybe you want to be a generous person, but you don't help anyone because you are "too busy."\
But even after you get to the top, you'll always be "too busy" to make the time to give someone a hand.\
If there's something you truly want, be commmitted to it.\
Do it every day, no matter what.\
That will make all the difference.\

## English Writing : Day 27

### Nourish yourself.

Nourishing yourself is imperative.\
It will help you stay focused, produce quality results, make better choices, and become more intentional as you go through the day.\
This is one of my favorite analogies.\
Let's say that someone offers you a meal, and in return you have to do whatever that person asks you to do.\
It sounds ridiculous, but if you think about it, you'll likely take the offer without hesitating if you've been starving for many days.\
If you don't want to be dragged into doing things you don't want to do, feed your spirit.\
What makes you feel joyous?\
What helps you stay connected to your values?\
What brings out your best qualities?\
Find your own ways, and make it a routines.

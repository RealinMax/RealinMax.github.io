Title:  "Choose Your Stories"
---

## English Writing : Day 24

### Choose your stories.

Don't hold on to false beliefs.\
Ditch all the lies about yourself or the world.\
Get ride of old stories if they no longer serve you.\
It's time for you to teach yourself new beliefs.\
Deliberately choose them every day if they help propel you forward.\
"You are worthy," "You have the power to create an amazing life," "You can handle any problems," "There are many people who love you and support you."\
If you believe these stories, that's what you'll end up creating in your life, just like the famous quote: "Whether you believe you can or can't, you are always right."

## English Writing : Day 21

### Don't play the blame game.

Don't play the blame game.\
It has zero benefits.\
If you can suddenly feel pappier by resenting others for what they've done, do it.\
But I bet it won't work.\
If you can solve a problem by pointing fingers, do it.\
But I'm pretty sure it will only perpetuate the pain.\
I'm not just talking about other people; don't blame yourself when things go wrong, either.\
Finding out who did what wrong and blaming them is not what you want to do, because it's not that useful.\
If you can focus your energy on fixing the problem, that would be better.\
If you can prevent a future problem, that would be the best.

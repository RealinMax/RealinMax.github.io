Title:  "Give Yourself What You Deserve"
---

## English Writing : Day 22

### Give yourself what you deserve.

You are a precious human.\
You deserve more than overly concentrated pleasures designed to make you addicted to them.\
They don't help you flourish.\
You desire true, long-lasting fulfillment instead of instant gratification.\
A healthier body, quality time with loved ones, and a deep sense of achievement.\
So if you want to rest your mind, just do it.\
You can read books that nurture your soul, declutter your thoughts by meditating or journaling, listen to a song that puts you at ease, or have a loving conversation with yourself or whoever you believe is the higher power.\
Decide not to think about what's left undone or unsolved.\
Actually, happiness is very simple.\
Start giving yourself what you truly deserve, and you'll have a happier life.

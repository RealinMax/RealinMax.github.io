## English Writing : Day 13

### Stop bullying yourself.

"I am stupid," "What's wrong with me?"\
These are the things that I used to say to myself.\
For so many years, I had bullied myself for being who I was because I couldn't see the value in myself.\
One day, I decided that I was going to put an end to this.\
I made a commitment to never beat myself up again.\
From that moment forward, slowly but suely, I started to appreciate myself.\
Instead of not approving of myself, I started giving myself credit.\
And let me tell you, committing to stop bullying myself was one of the best decisions I've ever made.\
After that decision, I was able to meet the most loving and supportive friend I'd ever made myself.

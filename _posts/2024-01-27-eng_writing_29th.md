## English Writing : Day 29

### Set up for success.

Create any environment that's easy for you to succeed in.\
You may have experienced that when you feel empowered, you can easily tap into your inner wisdom.\
Pesky problems can't even bother you.\
It's up to you to make yourself happy, generate your own energy, and be connected to your intentions.\
You can create an environment that makes it easy for you to do that.\
You can collect all your joyful moments in a notebook, make a go-to confidence boost playlist, or you can get creative and try your own idea.\
Whatever it is, make it a daily routine.\
If you set your life up this way, you become unstoppable.\
No one can stop you or take your joy away.

### Take every day as an opportunity.

Several years ago, I was in sadness.\
This sadness lasted longer than I thought.\
The whole time, I told myself that I shouldn't feel this way.\
I felt ashamed about my sadness.\
A few weeks later, one of my coaches gave me a whole new perspective on life.\
"If you are someone who loves yourself fiercely, what would you think about yourself being sad?"\
When I internalized this question, I was able to become compassionate towards myself.\
I made a choice to take every day as an opprotunity to love myself.\
Surprisingly, the sadness disappeared.\
Even if it hadn't, I would've never regretted making that choice.\
I challenge you to love yourself even when it's difficult.

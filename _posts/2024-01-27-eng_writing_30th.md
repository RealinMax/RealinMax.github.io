## English Writing : Day 30

### Have fun in the way.

Are you having fun in the process of reaching your goals?
If not, you might want to check a few things.
First, check if you have created a goal from a place of scarcity.
Meaning, if the reason you set your goal is there's something wrong with where you are or you don't have enough chances are, you'll dread your way there.
Second, check if you forgot or dismissed your "why" and are caught up with just the action and result.
Ironically, the more you genuinely enjoy the journey rather than rushing into getting a result, the more you'll create.
So remember what first got you started.
With that energy, be happy with the process of achieving your goals.

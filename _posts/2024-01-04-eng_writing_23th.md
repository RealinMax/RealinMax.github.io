Title:  "Change The way You Talk"
---

## English Writing : Day 23

### Change the way you talk.

A lot of people think they will be happy once they get what they want.\
The truth is, happiness is not something that comes from the outside, but it's what you find on the inside.\
What really determines your happiness are your thoughts about yourself.\
Your inner dialogue shapes the quality of your life.\
What do you usually say to yourself?\
Whenever you make a mistake, are you saying mean things like, "You are so stupid?"\
If your inner dialogue is critical and negative all the time, that's what you will experience in life.\
If you wnat to feel better, practice choosing the thoughts that will serve you.

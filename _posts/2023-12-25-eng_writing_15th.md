## English Writing : Day 15

### Send love to your body.

Have you ever appreciated your body?\
Your body does its job wonderfully every day.\
It moves you. It remembers things for you. It protects you.\
It's almost impossible to imagine life without it.\
Are you grateful that you can see with your eyes?\
Are you grateful that you can write with you hands?\
Or do you take it all for granted?\
Nothing is nothing.\
Everything is a beautiful gift what's been given to us.\
When it gets tired, take care of it, instead of beating it up.\
Treat it with respect. Give it what it deserves.\
Stay hydrated, sleep well, and exercise.\
Let you body know how much you appreciate it.

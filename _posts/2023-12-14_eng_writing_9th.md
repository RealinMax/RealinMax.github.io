Title:  "Expect to Make Mistakes"

## English Writing : Day 9

### Expect to make mistakes.

Expect to make some mistakes if you have incredibly high standards for yourself.\
This is important, because in order to make mistakes, you have to take real actions.\
This does not mean just researching.\
It means putting it to the market, making offers to your clients, and letting your voice be spoken into the world.\
Don't even try to make it perfect from the start.\
That only paralyzes you from moving forward.\
Don't underestimate what you can do, either.\
So many things are possible if you just keep going

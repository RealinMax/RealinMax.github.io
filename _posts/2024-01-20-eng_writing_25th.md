Title:  "Being Positive is Powerful."

## English Writing : Day 25

### Being positive is powerful.

Being positive doesn't mean you are in denial of reality or are to naive and believe the world is a fairy land.\
Being positive is a deliberate choice and is the ability to see the good in things everywhere.\
It's the power to not let circumstances take control of you.\
If you think you are a negative person, I have good news: no one is naturally born that way.\
A grateful person isn't someone who somehow only experiences pleasures in life.\
Everyone has a human brain, so if they can always find the good in all circumstances, you can do it, too.

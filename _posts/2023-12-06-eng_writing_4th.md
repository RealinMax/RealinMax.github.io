### You are a precious human

You ar th one and only, precious human.\
There's no noe like you.\
No one has hte perfect combination of your history, personality, and perspective.\
That's tremendously valuable.\
No one can copy or reproduce who you are.\
Are there any changes you want to see in the world?\
Go ahead and spread your messages everywhere.\
Don't worry if it's not original enough.\
Why? First, even if it's already been said or done a million times, it hasn't been done with your personality.\
Second, there are some people in the world who are destined to listen to your emssages.

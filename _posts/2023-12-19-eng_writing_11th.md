### How to not get criticized.

As long as you are doing something in this world, criticism will follow.\
The only sure way to never get criticized by anyone is to do absolutely nothing.\
If you don't put yourself out there, don't speak your mind, and just do what you are told, then maybe you'll be safe from criticism.\
You can eliminate the chance of someone criticizing you if you just stay in your comfort zone.\
But even then, you might have an inner critic, blaming you for the thins you are not doing.\
It's not worth it to avoid criticism at the expense of living life on your own terms.\
Life isn't about dodging, it's about attacking and moving forward.

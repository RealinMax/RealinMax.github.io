Title:  "Don't Make It A Problem"
---

## English Writing : Day 31

### Don't make it a problem.

There is great power in powerlessness.\
There is great value in stillness.\
There is a lesson in every different chapter of your life.\
And, it's completely natural for you to have low evergy at times.\
But the problem is you don't want to have those days at all, or you just don't know how to get out of a place where you feel like you're spiritually disconnected.\
So I'll tell you. First, don't make it a problem. It's not.\
Second, be a human. You are not a robot.\
You can still give so much value if you show up even with the low evergy.\
Third, listen to the things that will lift you up without any pressure.\
Just expose yourself to things like inspiring books, songs, or any type of audio message.

## English Writing : Day 19

### Drop expectations.

Do you know what the best part is about loving people the way they are, without having to change them?
You get to be in control of your feelings.
No matter how bad people are at following your expectations, you don't have to feel upset.
Of course, you can set boundaries to protect yourself, or you can let people know about the consequences if you need to lead them, but you still don't need to go through unnecessary drama.
You can make yourself happy without waiting for others to do it for you.
You'll get to enjoy all the things you do for them in a relationship, because you'll do it out of your won joy.
The truth is people get to be who they are, just like you get to be whoever you are.
Accept this wonderful fact, and relationships will feel a lot easier.

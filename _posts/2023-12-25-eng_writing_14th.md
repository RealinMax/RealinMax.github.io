Title:  "Write A Letter To Your Past Self"
---

## English Writing : Day 14

### Write a letter to your past self.

Writing a letter to your past self can be a beautiful way to come to peace with your past, so that you can focus on the present moment.\
Make sure to write it from a loving and non-judgemental space.\
Take what you can learn and peacefully move on.\
It can go something like this: Dear Past Self, I am sorry for all the mean things I said to you.\
I'm sorry for hating you, not believing in you and wishing that I'd rather be somebody else.\
I want to tell you that from now on I will always love and appreciate you.\
Thank you for being yourself.\
I love you.

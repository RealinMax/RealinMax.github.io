Title:  "Set An Intention"
---

## English Writing : Day 32

### Set an intention.

Setting an intention in the morning is a great way to design your day.\
Directly going through your day without intentional planning is like stepping back from the driver's seat and letting random people or events run your day.\
It's either you run the day, or the day runs you.\
Ask questions like, "How do I want to show up today?", "What do I want to remember?", or "How do I want to handle the challenge if it comes up?"\
All of these questions will help you live consciously instead of being on autopilot mode.\
It doesn't take long.\
It can even take just one minute to choose one question and think about how you want to live your day.\
This simple practice can turn your same old day upside down.
